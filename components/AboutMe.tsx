        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I&apos;m a 14-year-old developer and designer from Germany. I design
          websites using Figma and am currently expanding my skills with Next.js
          and React. Along the way, I&apos;ve gained experience with Tailwind
          and various programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++ for
          Arduino.
          <br />
          <br />
          Recently, I switched to Linux and I really don&apos;t regret it: I
          love its performance and customizability. When I&apos;m not coding,
          you&apos;ll often find me in the world of Minecraft â€” recording,
          animating and cutting cinematic shots, experimenting with command
          blocks, and developing data packs. I enjoy the challenge of working
          within creative constraints to solve problems in unique ways.

          Let&apos;s build something amazing together! ðŸš€
